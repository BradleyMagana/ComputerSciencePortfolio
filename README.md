#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
When interpreting users' needs and implementing them, we need to look at the user's feedback as well as conducting sytems analysis
to start with. From there, we can make modifications to the code, continually getting feedback from testers to ensure a successful
final product. User stories are a great way to organize and show users' needs/problems of a specif project or future project. 
User stories create a simplistic way for a user to say what they want to be done, and then the back end to make that simple request 
into a  complex reality. 

#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Developing programs can be achieved in many different ways; you can use the Waterfall method or even the Agile approach
we talked about heavily in the course. In terms of an agile process, I hope to bring the agile methodology of scrum; it 
gives me the best ways to work with testing, planning, and integration for the future.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
When identifying the key characteristics of a good team member in software development, we can determine 
that a good leader will have excellent communication abilities and take full responsibility for their responsibilities. 
A good team member is organized, shows up on time, and has a great collaborative perspective as well as treats others 
with respect but also can give constructive criticism where needed.
